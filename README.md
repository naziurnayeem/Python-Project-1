Blinkit Data Analysis using Python

This is my first project on Data Analysis using Python. The project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Blinkit dataset to uncover meaningful business insights. The analysis examines sales performance, product characteristics, outlet types and behaviour patterns to understand the key factors influencing sales.

KPI's :
1. Total Sales = $ 1201681.5
2. Average Sales = $ 141.0
3. No of items sold = 8523
4. Average rating = 4.0 out of 5.0

Graphical Representation on:
1. Total sales by fat content: From the pie chart, we can see that Low Fat products sales 65% of the total sales, while the Regular fat products sales 35% of the total sales. That means customers prefer Low Fat products more than Regular fat products.

2. Total sales by item type: The bar chart shows that the highest sales product is Fruits and vegetables and the lowest sales product is Seafood.

3. Fat content by outlet for total sales: The graph shows that Low Fat products consistently generate higher sales than Regular fat products in all outlet tiers.

4. Total sales by outlet establishment: The line chart shows the highest sales were in 1998 and the lower sales in 2011. The sales remained relatively stable between 2000 and 2022.

5. Sales by outlet size: Medium outlets sales is highest (42.3%) of the total sales and the high outlet sales is lowest of the total sales (20.7%)

6. Total sales by outlet location: Tier 3 outlets contribute the highest share of total sales where Tier 1 outlets contribute the lowest.
