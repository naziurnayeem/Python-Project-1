Blinkit Data Analysis using Python

This is my first project on Data Analysis using Python. The project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Blinkit dataset to uncover meaningful business insights. The analysis examines sales performance, product characteristics, outlet types and behaviour patterns to understand the key factors influencing sales.

KPI's :
1. Total Sales
2. Average Sales
3. No of items sold
4. Average rating

Graphical Representation on:
1. Total sales by fat content: From the pie chart, we can see that Low Fat products sales 65% of the total sales, while the Regular fat products sales 35% of the total sales. That means customers prefer Low Fat products more than Regular fat products.

2. Total sales by item type
3. Fat content by outlet for total sales
4. Total sales by outlet establishment
5. Sales by outlet size
6. Total sales by outlet location
